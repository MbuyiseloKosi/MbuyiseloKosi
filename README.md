👋 Hi, I'm Mbuyiselo 

I am learning bacend development and documenting the process in public.

My current focus is on making sure I have strong fundamentals:
  - Understanding how APIs work
  - Learning how data flows through systems
  - Writing clean, readable code

Very much a WIP

Tech I'm currently working on:
- Language: Python
- Backend: FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Tools: Git, Github, Linux
- Currently learning : APIs, databases, backend fundamentals

What you'll find here
  - Small projects as I learn
  - Experiments and notes

I intend to follow a simple loop:

Learn → Build → Break → Fix → Write → Repeat

🌱 Current Focus

- Backend fundamentals
- REST APIs
- Databases & data modeling
- Writing better code every week
